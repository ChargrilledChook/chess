## Possible future additions

### User facing
* Improve UX feedback - why a move failed (invalid move, you are in check etc)
* Improve saving system (more files, custom naming)
* A Puzzle mode - mate in 3 etc

### Internal
* Various refactorings - particularly en passant, castling, and reducing size of ref and round classes
* Increase test coverage
* More unit tests
* Integration testing?

## Known Bugs

* It is possible to put yourself in check while doing an en pasasnt move, leading to an illegal board state. This will raise an exception.
